# This Action commits any readme and WordPress.org-specific assets changes in your specified branch to the
# WordPress.org plugin repository if no other changes have been made since the last deployment to WordPress.org.
# This is useful for updating things like screenshots or Tested up to separately from functional changes, provided
# your Git branching methodology avoids changing anything else in the specified branch between functional releases.
